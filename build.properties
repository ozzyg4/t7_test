<!-- ===================== Property Definitions =========================== -->


<!--

  Each of the following properties are used in the build script.
  Values for these properties are set by the first place they are
  defined, from the following list:

  * Definitions on the "ant" command line (ant -Dfoo=bar compile).

  * Definitions from a "build.properties" file in the top level
    source directory of this application.

  * Definitions from a "build.properties" file in the developer's
    home directory.

  * Default definitions in this build.xml file.

  You will note below that property values can be composed based on the
  contents of previously defined properties.  This is a powerful technique
  that helps you minimize the number of changes required when your development
  environment is modified.  Note that property composition is allowed within
  "build.properties" files as well as in the "build.xml" script.

<!-- ==================== File and Directory Names ======================== -->


<!--

  These properties generally define file and directory names (or paths) that
  affect where the build process stores its outputs.

  app.name             Base name of this application, used to
                       construct filenames and directories.
                       Defaults to "myapp".

  app.path             Context path to which this application should be
                       deployed (defaults to "/" plus the value of the
                       "app.name" property).

  app.version          Version number of this iteration of the application.

  build.home           The directory into which the "prepare" and
                       "compile" targets will generate their output.
                       Defaults to "build".

  catalina.home        The directory in which you have installed
                       a binary distribution of Tomcat.  This will
                       be used by the "deploy" target.

  dist.home            The name of the base directory in which
                       distribution files are created.
                       Defaults to "dist".

  manager.password     The login password of a user that is assigned the
                       "manager-script" role (so that he or she can execute
                       commands via the "/manager" web application)

  manager.url          The URL of the "/manager" web application on the
                       Tomcat installation to which we will deploy web
                       applications and web services.

  manager.username     The login username of a user that is assigned the
                       "manager-script" role (so that he or she can execute
                       commands via the "/manager" web application)
